                <h2>Surespot Terms of Service </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Your Acceptanc <br>
        This Terms of Service is a legally binding contract between you, a user of the Service ("you", "your" or "user"), and surespot LLC ("surespot", "we", "our"), governing your use of the Service through mobile or web services and software owned, controlled, licensed or offered by surespot.  BY USING SURESPOT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND SURESPOT'S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT https://www.surespot.me/ , AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.   If you choose not to agree with any of these terms, you shall not use the Service at any time.</li>

        <li>Surespot Service<br>
        The surespot Service is a downloadable software application for mobile devices (or web service) which allows its users to send and receive encrypted messages and files including photo, voice and video (the "Service").  Software for the Service is free to download and free to use, except when you use surespot on a cellular network, rather than via Wi-Fi, in which case, standard data rates may apply, according to your wireless plan.
        The surespot Service uses proven encryption strategies.  Surespot does not guarantee that such encryption will not be able to be decrypted in the future by unauthorized third parties.
        These Terms of Service apply to all users of the surespot Service.  Information provided by our users through the Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by surespot.  Surespot has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites.  In addition, surespot will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.  By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that surespot shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.</li>

        <li>Surespot Access<br>
        A. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, surespot hereby grants you a non-exclusive, limited, revocable and non-assignable license to use the Service, provided that your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal use, and you are not permitted to transfer, resell or charge others for use of or access to the Service, and you are not permitted to use the Service in any other manner inconsistent with these Terms of Service.
       <br> B. In order to access and use the share feature of the Service, you hereby give your express consent to surespot to access your contact list/address book on your mobile device to find email addresses and text numbers for the recipients you specify.  We do not use, copy, modify, store or share user contact data.
       <br> C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots", "spiders", "offline readers", etc.  or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc. that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the surespot servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using the surespot application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, surespot grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archive of such materials.  Surespot reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.  You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain.  You agree not to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes.  You agree not to spam, or solicit for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.</li>

        <li>User Data<br>
        The surespot Service allows the submission of content and materials by you ("User Data"), and the hosting, storing of such User Data.  You shall be solely responsible for your own User Data and the consequences of storing or transmitting them.  Surespot assumes no responsibility whatsoever in connection with or arising from User Data or for actively monitoring User Data for inappropriate or illegal content.  Surespot does not endorse and has no control over the content of User Data submitted by users.  Surespot reserves the right to prevent you from submitting User Data and to restrict or remove User Data for any reason at any time.  Surespot reserves the right to limit storage space provided to each User to 1000 messages or less.  The oldest User Data will be permanently deleted automatically by the Service to accommodate new messages as needed.</li>

        <li>Modification of This Agreement<br>
        Surespot may modify this Terms of Service from time to time.  Any and all changes to this Agreement will be posted on the surespot.me site, and you agree to be bound by any changes to the Terms of Service when you continue to use the surespot Service after those changes are posted.</li>

        <li>Usage Rules; Prohibited Conduct and Uses<br>
        YOU UNDERSTAND AND HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY NOT AND WARRANT THAT YOU WILL NOT:

        <li>Export Control; Compliance with Laws<br>
        The Service contains encryption technology that is or may be specifically controlled for export by the United States government.

It is your responsibility to comply with foreign laws and regulations on encryption import, export or use.  When you download the surespot application you are certifying to surespot that you are eligible to receive products exported from the United States, without any restrictions.

        <li>Violations; Termination<br>
        You agree that surespot may terminate or suspend your access to the Service without prior notice and without liability if such termination or suspension is based on (a) surespot's good faith belief that you have violated any of the terms and condition of these Terms of Service, (b) surespot's determination that you infringe or violate or have infringed or violated the intellectual property rights of others, (c) extended periods of inactivity with respect to the Service.  These remedies are in addition to any other remedies surespot may have at law or in equity.  Surespot also reserves the right to terminate Free Accounts and free access to the Service at any time, with or without notice for any reason or no reason without any liability of any kind.   Surespot reserves the right to terminate any account considered as squatting on a username, or accounts that are deemed as spammers, or violate any laws of the United States.
