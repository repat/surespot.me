					<h2>Data and Threat Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <h3>surespot stores the following data on its servers:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Usernames.</li>
                        <li>Friend relationships (who is friends with who, blocked who, ignored who, deleted who).</li>
                        <li>Conversation relationships (how many friends currently you have a "conversation" with - meaning have a sent or
                            received a message with).
                        </li>
                        <li>Messages in the amount of MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER (currently 1000) which each have a server timestamp, to
                            username, from username, and encrypted data, or link to encrypted data (image or file).
                        </li>
                        <li>Message file data (image or other - anything but plain message text) is stored (encrypted in the same way text
                            messages are) on rackspace cloud files.
                        </li>
                        <li>Total messages sent per user.</li>
                        <li>Total images sent per user.</li>
                        <li>Current message count per user. (How many messages they have stored in the database currently, will always be <=
                            MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER (currently 1000)).
                        </li>
                        <li>Signing (DSA) public keys and versions.</li>
                        <li>Encryption (DH) public keys and versions.</li>
                        <li>Encrypted "friend images" or avatars that are assigned to certain usernames. These are encrypted with a key
                            generated from ECDH key derivation of assigning identity's private/public keypair.
                        </li>
                        <li>Google Cloud Messaging(GCM) ID (used for push messaging) which is related to the username in the surespot database.</li>
                        <li>If voice messaging is purchased, a purchase token given to us by google which is related to the username in the surespot database.</li>
                        <li>Ip addresses are only logged in the case of rate limit abuses.</li>
                        <li>Server logs may contain any of the above information and are in a 20 log - 5MB per log rotation.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Database Exposure.</h3>

                    <p>If an attacker were to obtain access to the surespot database they would have access to the above information. As
                    surespot does not ask for an email address, phone number, or any other piece of identifying information to create an account
                    the only pieces of data that could possibly tie a username to a google account or the device being used are the GCM
                    (google cloud messaging - push notification) ID, or the voice purchase token.
                    If an attacker were to gain access to both Google's database and surespot's database they could potentially correlate the data.</p>

                    An attacker that gained access to the surespot database server could delete or otherwise corrupt user data,
                    potentially disrupting the surespot service.

                <h3>Mitigation 1</h3>

                    <p>Any discovery of a user's real identity can be mitigated by using an anonymous email account
                    to register with Google as well as a pre-paid or no contract phone that has no ties to the user.</p>

                    <p>As another mitigation strategy, an advanced user could compile their own surespot client from source
                    and prevent a GCM ID from ever uploading to the surespot server and completely remove this threat. This
                    functionality could easily (and probably will) become a user setting in the client.</p>

                    <p>Even if an attacker were to gain access to all of the data stored in the surespot database there is not a way they could read the
                    encrypted message data without the user's  private key which resides on their device and is never sent to surespot servers.
                    Because usernames are completely arbitrary and chosen by the user with no mapping other than to the GCM ID (which is meaningless outside of Google's
                    database), the surespot database in an attacker's hands represents an anonymous and practically useless dataset.</p>

                    <p>Passwords are stored salted and hashed in the surespot database rendering them useless to an attacker. Even if a user were to expose their password,
                    without the private key which resides on the device the attacker can do nothing to decrypt a user's messages.</p>
                    
                    Regular backups of the database are encrypted using AES-256 and stored offsite.

                <h3>Server exposure</h3>

                    <p>If an attacker were to gain access to a surespot server machine they would have the ability to prevent surespot from
                    working by changing the server private keys forcing all public key validation to fail on the client. As public keys are cached
                    when they are verified this would only affect messages generated with keys that have not been cached already.</p>

                    <p>An attacker could perform a MITM attack by creating a new public key pair and signatures for a user which to a client would appear legitimate and thus
                    enable continuing of a conversation.</p>

                    An attacker would have access to the database and could delete all of the data.

                <h3>Migation 2</h3>

                    <p>While not currently implemented the client side key generation mechanism could be improved to have the client sign the new
                    public keys with the old private key. This would create a trust chain
                    going back to the initial key pairs. Any new key presented to a client could be validated against the previous key's
                    signatures. Because all private key generation occurs on the client, and public keys are cached on the client once validated, a rogue server
                    would not be able to influence this check.</p>

                    <p>In the event of a server compromise the server could be rebuilt from the database backup in minutes.
                    New server private keys would be created which would  require an upgrade to the client.</p>

                <h3>Man in the Middle prevention</h3>

                    <p>On top of SSL surespot prevents MITM attacks in the following way.</p>

                    The user creation mechanism in the client generates two ECC 521 bit public/private key pairs, one for encryption and
                    one for signing. The two public keys are uploaded to the surespot server
                    along with the desired username and PBKDF derived password. The server then signs the user public keys with its
                    private key. The client is compiled with the server's public key.
                    When a message is received the client downloads the sending user's public keys and server signatures. The key signatures are then validated
                    against the compiled public key and if the validation fails the message cannot be decrypted and the user is told.

                <h3>Identity (private key) backup</h3>

                    <p>Practically, identity (username + private key) backup mechanisms are needed to facilitate the features people expect
                    from a social network like application. In the event of a lost or stolen phone
                    one can not expect a user to simply create a new identity and lose
                    all of the relationships and conversations contained within the application. Hence surespot provides two identity
                    backup mechanisms which have different threat implications.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Backing up one's identity to local storage using the "backup identity" feature in surespot is the safest
                        mechanism. It reduces the key exposure to devices that have physically had the key
                        copied to them. As long is one as careful to not give the private key to anyone there is minimal threat introduced
                        here. If an attacker were to gain access to the private key it is stored
                        encrypted with 256 bit AES-GCM with a key derived from the user's password using a PBKDF, so they would have to know the user's password
                        also.</li>

                        <li>Backing up one's identity to Google Drive opens up the following threats. The identity
                        is stored (as above encrypted with 256 bit AES-GCM with a PKBDF key derived from password) on Google Drive's cloud servers.
                        This means that we cannot control who gets access to this encrypted backup, we are trusting Google to ensure that no-one can access our private keys.
                        Again as the keys are encrypted, the obtainer of the keys would have to know or brute force the password to do anything with them. This threat
                        grows if the Google account password and surespot password are the same. For all we know Google could be storing passwords in plain text!
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Mitigation 3</h3>

                    <p>Ensure google and surespot passwords are completely different, and strong, and use local device identity backup
                    only if possible.</p>

                <h3>Stored client data</h3>

                    No decrypted message contents are stored on the device filesystem. The user's identity (username plus private keys) is
                    stored encrypted on the device with 256 bit AES-GCM using a salted key derived from a PBKDF upon the user's password. An
                    attacker with access to the device  would have to know the user's password to be able to decrypt the private key to generate the shared secret to decrypt
                    the messages.

                <h3>Caching</h3>

                    Shared secrets are cached in the device memory by a background service that starts when the application is
                    launched for the first time after the phone is booted.
                    After a successful login has occurred shared secrets are cached in the device memory and used as needed.
                    An attacker with physical access to the device that has shared secrets cached could
                    potentially scan or dump the memory for the secrets and decrypt messages. There is not a lot that can be done to prevent an attacker
                    getting access to the data they want should this threat scenario occur.
                    Various protections could be put in place to make this harder but a
                    determined hacker with device access in this scenario will probably be able to gain access to the information
                    they seek no matter what precautions are put in place.


                <h3>Mitigation 4</h3>

                    <p>Be careful with your device; don't allow root access to unknown apps; don't install malicious software, and don't
                    let your device fall into the wrong hands.</p>

                    If possible, powering down the phone before a unwanted party gains physical access will
                    clear this information from the device memory and require login to surespot again to view messages.

                <h3>Login validation, sessions, and web method access</h3>

                    Sessions are created by checking the user's password plus a signature validation of the username, password, and a
                    random token generated by the client, against the data stored by the server upon creation of the identity. Replay
                    attacks / session hijacking are prevented by
                    SSL. If this is deemed to be too insecure, additional security could be implemented with a challenge/response
                    mechanism as used by the majorly destructive operations described below.<br><br>

                    Because sending and receiving messages that can actually be read requires a private key and validated public key,
                    a session hijacker without the associated private key would not be able to read any of the
                    associated encrypted message data, nor send a readable message to a user.

                    A session hijacker would be able to delete messages and images, invite and remove friends (from the list of friends, not actually delete the associated
                    identities), and
                    change image unlock state.

                    <p>Majorly destructive operations such as deleting an identity, generating new key pairs, and changing passwords require re-authentication which
                    includes checking a client signature against a token issued by the server
                    so could not occur with a hijacked session.</p>
                    A majorly destructive operation can only be initiated by a client with a valid username and matching private key set so again an attacker
                    would have
                    to gain access to the device and know the password to be able to accomplish execution of any of the majorly destructive operations.

                <h3>Encryption strength</h3>

                    All messages and data (images and other files) are encrypted using 256 bit AES-GCM with the shared key derived using
                    ECDH with 521 bit keys. The shared key is never uploaded to any server or stored physically on the device. It
                    is only ever generated and stored in device memory. Assuming the private key remains private it would be extremely
                    hard to decrypt any message sent with surespot today.

                <h3>Lost/Stolen device</h3>

                    In the case of a lost or stolen device there exist the following threats.
                    As a surespot session lasts 72 hours (we plan on making this user configurable),
                    the attacker holding a device where surespot has a valid session will be able to open surespot and view any messages.

                <h3>Current Mitigation Strategies</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>A user can manually logout of surespot at any time. They will then have to login to gain access to messages.
                            This
                            is not very convenient but it is the most secure option.
                        </li>

                        <li>Upon realizing that their device is missing a user can restore a backup of their identity to a different device and
                            generate a new key pair. The existing keys will then be revoked causing
                            the following effects on the missing device:
                            If the application is open and running the identity will be logged out
                            (if it is logged in) and the identity and all associated data will be immediately deleted from the device, and any associated shared secrets removed
                            from the memory cache. If the application is not open and running, the user will not be able to login to surespot using the revoked identity upon
                            opening the application the next time.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </h2>

                <h3>Rogue clients</h3>

                    There is no way for any software to guarantee the behavior of a client, or that the client is "authentic" and has
                    not been tampered with in some way. Features such as deleting a message from a remote device, or
                    deleting a revoked identity depend upon the client obeying the instructions the server sends it. There always exists
                    the potential for an unsavory user to create or use a hacked or modified client and not perform the expected
                    actions when asked to by the server. The good news is that there is no way for a rogue client to compromise the
                    security of a message. In order for a rogue client to engage in a conversation with a legitimate
                    client, the rogue client would have to abide by the same rules - that is use the same encryption methods, follow the
                    same key generation procedures, etc., therefore the actual act of encrypted message
                    exchange would have to be preserved, otherwise no encrypted message exchange could occur. In short put your trust in
                    the users you are exchanging data with, not in any technology that claims it can control what
                    a client (rogue or legitimate) does with that data once it has received it.
