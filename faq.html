					<h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p><strong>Download</strong> - Download and install surespot from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twofours.surespot"> Google Play
            Store</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/surespot/id790314865">App Store</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Create an identity</strong> - Usernames are case sensitive and the only way you will be identified. <em>Passwords can NEVER be reset
            or recovered!</em></p>

        <p><strong>Backup and Restore Identities.</strong> YOU MUST preserve your identity by saving to Device Storage or Google Drive.
            Your identity contains your encryption keys and to protect your privacy we do not store them.
            If you get a new phone or uninstall/reinstall surespot you will need to restore your identity.</p>

        <p><strong>Inviting other surespot users</strong> - From the home screen invite other users, usernames are case sensitive and unique.
            You can also pop up your QR code and have others scan it.</p>

        <p><strong>Inviting others to use surespot</strong> - From the menu choose "invite contacts". From there you can choose to
            send an auto-invitation by email, text or by social media. You can choose people from your contact book
            to send to or just type their number or email in. surespot does not mine your contacts to automatically to
            find other users because we do not store your phone number or email, or any other identifying information.</p>

        <p><strong>Assigning Avatars</strong> - Once a friend has accepted your invitation you can assign a picture to them by long pressing
            their name on the home page and selecting "assign image". You can choose any image from your device. </p>

        <p><strong>Send a Message</strong> - Touch a friends name on the home page to open a conversation tab. The first message  sent may take a moment as the
            key exchange occurs. Now the two of you share the secret key that allows you to decrypt each others messages. NO ONE ELSE can decrypt these messages
            and images, not even us. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <p><strong>Voice Messages</strong> - Hold down the microphone button to record your voice message, release it to send. A countdown timer lets you know
            how much time you have left.  If the conversation tab is open, a received voice message will play aloud immediately otherwise touch once
            to play and again to stop.</p>

        <p><strong>Emoji</strong> - On Android, surespot uses an open source emoji library that anyone can contribute to. The
            library is getting bigger all the time. Touch the randomly assigned emoji button to pull up the emoji keyboard,
            touch it again to put it away. On iOS, surespot uses the native emoji keyboard.</p>

        <p><strong>Pictures</strong> - You can select a picture to send from within surespot or by choosing share from the gallery. You can capture a picture within
            surespot and it will be saved to your gallery. Sent images are locked by default and cannot be saved to the receiver's gallery until you choose
            to unlock it by long pressing on the sent image.</p>

        <p><strong>Deleting Messages</strong> - Messages you send are under your control, when you delete them from your phone
            they will also be deleted from the receivers phone and the surespot server. The server limits message storage
            to 1000 messages, after which it will automatically delete the oldest message as you send new ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Blocking a User</strong> - When you don't want to talk to someone anymore just delete them from your friends list
            with a long press, this will delete all of your messages to them. If they invite you back you can
            block them. Blocking will only be removed if you choose to invite them again.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiple Identities.</strong> Need to be someone else? Identities on the same device do not share contact lists, preferences or keys.
            Delete the identity when you are done and all your messages get deleted, from everywhere.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>General</h2>

        <p><strong>surespot cannot see your messages</strong> - Every message and image sent using surespot is encrypted
            and can only be opened by the person you sent it to. Our servers never see your private key so we have no
            way of decrypting the messages. All anyone else sees is scrambled/ciphertext. </p>


        <p><strong>How exactly does surespot work?</strong> - We have written a <a href="how-it-works.html">rather lengthy explanation</a> to this question.
           Check it out.

        <p><strong>Do you have a Threat Model?</strong> - Again, here is the lengthy explanation how <a href="threat.html">surespot has your back.</a></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Troubleshoot</h2>

        <p><strong>Image / Voice Message did not send </strong> - A warning above the message and the black side bar will tell you to the message
            failed to reach the server and to long press to resend.</p>

        <p><strong>No text box in conversation tab</strong> - The user has either deleted themselves or you. Notice all the messages left
            are only yours? Delete them from your friends list with a long press to clean up.</p>

        <p><strong>Voice Messages do not record</strong> - surespot will not record an empty voice message so be sure not to cover the microphone or speak too softly.</p>

        <p><strong>Forgot my password </strong> - You are out of luck</p>

        <p><strong>Got a new phone/lost phone</strong> - You should have backed up your identity to cloud or hardware for transfer. You cannot just download a new surespot
           and sign-on. Your Key is in your identity and is only stored by you, we don't have it. Go to the settings menu for more information. Install surespot
           on your new phonethen choose "restore identity" from the login screen.</p>

         <p><strong>Error Decrypting message</strong> - From the settings menu you can choose "generate new key pairs" and follow the prompts. That should fix the
            issue for new messages.</p>

        <p><strong>Voice Messages send from some of my devices and not others</strong> - Android: if the same Google account is the default on both devices
           the voice messaging will only work on one of the devices.<br>
           iOS: if one of your devices doesn't think you have bought surespot messaging go to the voice purchase window and in the top right click "restore",
           this will restore  your purchase record to this device</p>
